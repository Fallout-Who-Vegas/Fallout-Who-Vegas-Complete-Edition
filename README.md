### FAQ

* **Do I need to install the mod from the nexus to use this**? 
No. The Complete Edition includes the entire base mod from the nexus (redistributed with permission). You should not install it at the same time as the complete edition.

* **Can I install this through Vortex?**
We recommend against this as Vortex has has more limited support for FOMOD installers. Our official recommendation is to use Mod Organizer 2 and we do not offer support for installation issues with Vortex.

* **Does this download include support mods which are unrelated to Fallout: Who Vegas, such as the JIP LN NVSE Plugin?**
No, the complete edition only includes Fallout Who Vegas and its addons. We do not redistribute other authors' work without permission. If you install an addon which has a dependency on another mod you will have to download and install it separately.

* **Is the mod compatible with xNVSE?**
Yes, but you must install the xNVSE patch when prompted during the install. This patch also requires [JIP LN NVSE Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277) which you will have to install separately.
